<div class=""woocommerce-product-details__short-description"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Samuel Dixon, the Dublin artist, who owned a “picture ware-room” on Capel Street, north of the river Liffey, where he ‘mass’ produced embossed papier-maché pictures of birds and flowers. These were hand coloured by his apprentices and sold in black and gold japanned frames. Dixon’s “Foreign &amp; Domestick Birds” appeared as a set of 12 in 1755.</div>
<div class=""woocommerce-product-details__short-description"" data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""></div>
<div class=""woocommerce-product-details__short-description"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Each picture carried a dedication on the reverse as well as a description of the subject matter to protect Dixon against imitators. As Mrs. Leask, has written in her history of Samuel Dixon: “It was very natural to seek the patronage of the Duchess of Dorset soon after the arrival of the Duke as Lord Lieutenant in 1753, and of Elizabeth, Duchess of Hamilton (one of the beautiful Gunnings from Co. Roscommon who had married the Duke in 1752”.</div>
